Web application - Project: Dynamic Webpage

## Description
Dynamic web application is a platform for employers to seek and learn about students of software development. 
It is also an open portal for students through which they can add their resume and be exposed to employers. 
## Graphical Profile
The platform should give the employers a sense of confidence. It is common that job matching platforms are easy to 
navigate through, so it should be user friendly as well. The choice of graphical components below is aimed to host a calm 
ambiance where employers can easily read about candidates and hopefully take the next step and contact the candidates.
