            <p>As a new type of addictive behaviors and distinct from traditional internet game addiction on desktop
                computers, mobile game addiction has attracted researchers' attention due to its possible negative
                effects on mental health issues. However, very few studies have particularly examined the relationship
                between mobile game addiction and mental health outcomes, due to a lack of specified instrument for
                measuring this new type of behavioral addiction.
                In this study, we examined the relationship between mobile game addition and social anxiety, depression,
                and loneliness among adolescents. We found that mobile game addiction was positively associated with
                social anxiety, depression, and loneliness.

            <p class="p-text-first"> Super Mario Bros. 3 is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for
                the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was released for home consoles in Japan on October 23, 1988
                and in Europe on August 29, 1991. </p>

            <p class="p-text-second">Players control brothers Mario or Luigi, who must save Princess Toadstool and the
                rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser. As in previous Mario games, they defeat
                enemies by stomping on them or using items that bestow magical powers; they also have new abilities,
                including flight and sliding down slopes. Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces many elements that became Mario
                series staples, such as Bowser's children (the Koopalings) and a world map to transition between levels.
                <br/><br/>
                Super Mario Bros. 3 was praised by critics and is listed as one of the greatest video games of all
                time. It is the third-best-selling NES game, with more than 17 million copies sold worldwide.
                It also inspired a short-lived animated television series produced by DiC Entertainment called The
                Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.

                Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a
                spinoff of League of Legends, where players compete online against seven
                other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game released as a League of Legends
                game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in
                March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them. Teamfight Tactics was based on Dota Auto Chess,
                which in turn was inspired by Mahjong, where players pick up tiles and discard tiles in order to
                complete a hand by forming a pair and sets such as a sequence, or three or four identical tiles, while
                preventing other players to complete a hand. The game had over 33 million monthly players with 1.72 billion
                hours of accumulated game time.
