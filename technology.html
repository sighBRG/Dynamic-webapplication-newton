                <h1>Computer says go: Taking orders from an AI boss</h1>
                <h3>If your first thought upon reading that sentence was "well it would be an improvement on my current
                    human one," you wouldn't be alone.

                    After all, an artificial intelligence (AI) software system might be better able to organise the
                    staff rota without messing up your holidays.

                    And getting some unbiased feedback from a line manager who can't be accused of having it in for you
                    or of favouring other staff could make a pleasant change.

                    However, for those of us who have seen the Terminator movies rather too often, the thought of a
                    computer, or robot, bossing you around is also bound to raise fears that the machines are in danger
                    of taking over.

                    Yet this ignores the fact that we already spend a lot of time obeying machines, and we don't even
                    think about it, let alone worry.

                    Jeff Schwartz, a senior partner at accountancy group Deloitte, and a global adviser on the future of
                    work, points to a simple everyday machine that we all obey unthinkingly.
                    "A traffic light used to be a job, there used to be a person who would stand there directing the
                    cars," he says. "But very clearly that is now a machine, and it is getting smarter - they are now
                    putting AI into traffic lights [so they can best respond to traffic levels]."

                    So it seems we are perfectly willing to take orders from a machine in some clearly defined
                    situations.

                    What has increasingly happened in recent years, however, is that more of us are already being
                    ordered around by computers at work. And experts say that this is only set to increase.

                    Take taxi firm Uber. There isn't a man or woman in the office giving out the jobs to the drivers. It
                    is done automatically by the company's AI software system.

                <h1>Bitcoin investors: From buying a Bentley to losing it all</h1>
                <h3>Bitcoin has soared to trade at an eye-watering $48,000 (£34,820), following the news that Tesla has
                    bought $1.5bn of the crypto-currency.

                    Enthusiasts will tell you it's the future of money - but investing in the notoriously volatile
                    virtual currency can be a rollercoaster, and it's not without risk. The hunt for new coins, using
                    powerful computers, is also causing a surge in energy demand - which is not so good for the
                    environment.</h3>

                <h3>
                    Mercedes-Benz is recalling more than one million cars over a safety defect with the cars' emergency
                    call system.

                    The problem is with the cars' eCall feature, which alerts emergency services of an accident and
                    relays a vehicle's location to them.

                    But a fault means it is possible that the wrong location could be sent.

                    The problem affects 1,292,258 cars in the United States, and the company says it is preparing a fix
                    for customers in other countries too.

                <h1>Robots deployed at A68A mega-iceberg remnants</h1>
                <h3>
                    UK scientists have arrived at the remains of what was once the biggest iceberg in the world to
                    investigate their impacts on the environment.

                    A68A, which for a long time had an area equal to a small country, gradually fragmented after
                    drifting away from Antarctica into the South Atlantic.

                    The RSS James Cook approached the biggest remaining segment on Sunday.

                    It deployed a robotic glider that will measure seawater salinity, temperature and chlorophyll close
                    to the ice.

                    This is information that will tell the scientists how the still significant blocks could be
                    affecting local marine life.
